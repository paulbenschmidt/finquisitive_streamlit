            These are luxuries that you would personally want to have in your life, but are a little bit more
            extravagant in nature. These could be things like a boat, a condo, or an annual trip to your favorite
            destination. Additionally, this could be a monthly donation to a cause that you're passionate about.

            In order to calculate the affordability of these luxuries, we'll use the **monthly payment** of the item.
            For example, if you wanted to buy a boat that costs \$50,000, with nothing down for the down payment,
            you would finance the \$50,000 over 5 years at a 5% interest rate and would result in a monthly payment
            of \$943.56.

            For help calculating the monthly payments for your specific luxuries, see the expander _Helper:
            Luxury Loan Payment Calculator_ below.
