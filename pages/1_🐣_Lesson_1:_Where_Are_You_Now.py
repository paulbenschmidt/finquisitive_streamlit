    Before beginning our financial journey, it's helpful to first understand where we are now. This will help us
    understand how our current situation tracks with the averages, because if we want average results (and that's
    ok if we do), we need to make sure that we're _at least_ following average behaviors. However, if we want
    better than average results (and that's probably going to be most of us), we need to find ways
    to beat these averages.
