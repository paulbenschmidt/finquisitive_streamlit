st.write("""
    When I met with my first financial advisor, I came in thinking that I would be wealthy just because I was
    doing what other people my age weren't doing: talking to financial advisors in college. The conversation went
    well, but I didn't end up learning much: we talked about saving and index funds. She signed me up for a few
    brokerage accounts, complimented me on my progress, and encouraged me to keep doing what I was doing.

    Years later, I realized that what I really wanted out of that meeting was to know, deep down, in my bones,
    that I was going to be ok, that the things I was doing were going to be enough to feel safe.

    Above all else, my hope is that through this lesson series we can start planting that seed of contentment
    and peace, growing into this idea that our principles and strategies, if followed consistently over time,
    will get us to where we want to go.

    So, to begin, we're going to start with a fun numbers game. Before we get into the nitty-gritties of
    financial principles and fundamental strategies, it's helpful to know where we are now. It's helpful to
    see how our current situation tracks with the averages, because if we want average results (and that's
    ok if we do), we need to make sure that we're _at least_ following average behaviors. However, if we
    want better than average results (and I'm sure that's going to be most, if not all, of us), we need
    to find ways to beat the average milestones and metrics.

    Without further ado, let's dig into some basic metrics on US expenses, income, assets/liabilities,
    and savings rates. As we do this, I want you to think about your current financial situation and
    the ways that you have similarities or differences.
