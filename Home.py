    **FinQuisitive** is a financial literacy application designed to teach financial principles interactively.

    While there are many books and courses that teach financial literacy, we felt that there was a lack of
    interactive tools that could help people learn about finance in a more engaging and relatable way:
    FinQuisitive fills that gap. In addition to calculating with your personal finance projections and quantifying
    your decisions, you'll learn a simple, efficient framework that takes the mystery out of finance and investing,
    providing principles for enjoying the most of life and wealth today _and_ in the future.
