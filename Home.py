    FinQuisitive is a financial literacy application designed to teach financial principles interactively.

    While there are many books and courses that teach financial literacy, we felt that there was a lack of
    interactive tools that could help people learn about finance in a more engaging and relatable way. We hope that
    FinQuisitive can fill that gap. And we hope that having a framework to think about your future will inspire
    you to make the most of your days in order to live a life of abundance, for yourself and those around you.

    With love and gratitude,

    The FinQuisitive Team
